# 🚀 Yasin & Mansur's Exercism Backup 

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the **backup storage** for **Yasin** and **Mansur's** Exercism progress.  

---

## 💾 Why this repo?  
You might be wondering: *"Why create a GitHub repository for our backup?"*  
Well… because we can. 😏  
Okay okay, the real reason: **Exercism needed Yasin to do a GitHub backup**.  
So, naturally, he used **Mansur’s GitHub** as the main storage vault... because Yasin is weird.  
Always has been, always will be. 🤷‍♂️

## 🧑‍💻 The Duo
- **Mansur** → The vault owner 🔑  
- **Yasin** → The one who started all this chaos ⚡

Thanks for stopping by, and good luck if you actually read all this. 🍀
